I developed these Google Scripts when I was working as Player Support Shift Lead. The Player Support Agents had to take care of some Store Reviews and I had to train them to do so. According to the Client, a video game company with several mobile games, we had to take care of replying to the following Store Reviews:
<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reviews with 3 stars or less.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reviews entered by those with either the current or the previous version installed.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reviews from the two stores: <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Google Play.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. App Store. 
<br /><br />
The problem of this task was that PS Agents were told to do it only when they were done with the high priority tasks and sometimes, these tasks were taking all the time, causing the reviews to be left undone. These Scripts allowed me to keep an eye on Store Reviews - when the backlog was extremely long, we were taking the opportunity to recommend the Client to allow PS Agents do some overtime.
<br /><br />
In order for the Scripts to be used, a Spreadsheet has to be prepared. This Spreadsheet will have the following Sheets:<br /><br />
